## There's not much to see here
This repo is just to house my vimrc to deal with the event where I either need to setup a new system or lose access to my working file locally. Maybe there's something fun for reference? 

Tbh this was mostly compiled from other people. No fancy vimscript just a bunch of plugins and color configurations. Maybe one day I'll write something snazzy.
